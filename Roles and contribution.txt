Gaoyuan Bao: I was responsible for data crawling, data format conversion, and setting up the Verba framework in this deliverable. In both the crawler.zip and verba.zip, I wrote read.me files to explain how to use the code. Since the import files for Verba framework are .txt and .md files, I also wrote a 'txt_version' program to convert the 'program' and 'program_detail' CSV files into a single TXT file. Regarding the setup of the Verba environment, remember to enter the OPENAI API KEY in the .env file during the evaluation and analysis stages.
